Welcome to Django Boilerplate documentation!
=========================================

This is an awesome **Django Project Boilerplate**!

With this code you can start a *complex* Django Project
very quickly, with just a few steps!

Some of the Django Project Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments**, for developing, testing and production
- Project Structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template inheritance
- Functional **tests**
- robots.txt and humans.txt configured

To start using the Boilerplate, check out the :doc: `requirements`
and next the :doc:`quick_start`.
